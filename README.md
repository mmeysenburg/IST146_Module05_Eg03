# IST146_Module05_Eg03

This repository contains the third example for IST 146 Module 5. 
The code shows how to read JSON data from the Web. 

## Instructions

1. Log on to your replit account. 
2. Click the "+ New repl" button to create a new repl. 
3. Click on the "Import from GitHub" tab. 
4. Type or paste the following URL into the "Paste any repository URL" text field: `github.com/mmeysenburg/IST146_Module05_Eg03`
5. Click on the "Import from github" button.
6. Click the "Done" button in the ".replit" dialog that appears.
7. THIS IS DIFFERENT: in the terminal area, execute this command: `mv replit .replit`. Executing this will set the classpath to allow
the program to read a JSON file.
8. Explore the code.
9. At any time you can run the code from the user's perspective, or, from a developer's point of view, execute the unit tests that have been provided.
  * To run the code, click the "Run" button.
  * To execute the unit tests (if any), enter the following command in the "Console" tab: `bash test.sh`
