# IST146_Module05_Eg03

This repository contains the third example for IST 146 Module 5. 
The code shows how to read JSON data from the Web. 

## Instructions

1. Log on to your replit account. 
2. Click the "+ New repl" button to create a new repl. 
3. Click on the "Import from GitHub" tab. 
4. Type or paste the following URL into the "Paste any repository URL" text field: `github.com/mmeysenburg/IST146_Module05_Eg03`
5. Click on the "Import from github" button.
6. Click the "Done" button in the ".replit" dialog that appears.
7. From the "Console" tab, enter the following command: `rm .replit` *If you omit this step, the "Run" button will not work as it should!*
8. Select the `Movie.java` file. Search for the keyword "TODO", and write the specified code.
9. At any time you can run the code from the user's perspective, or, from a developer's point of view, execute the unit tests that have been provided.
  * To run the code, click the "Run" button.
  * To execute the unit tests (if any), enter the following command in the "Console" tab: `bash test.sh`
10. Once you have completed the code correctly, the unit tests (if any) should pass, and running the code should produce results that make sense.
11. When you are finished, submit your `Movie.java` file via the Canvas assignment.
